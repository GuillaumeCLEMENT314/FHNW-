        "The alkali atoms going close to the walls, usually containing ions, will experience an increasing electric field as it gets closer, yielding a magnetic field, which depolarizes the atom. This effect can be mitigated by adding a buffer gas to reduce the probability of collisions with a wall using inert gases, or coatings on the walls to reduce drastically this gradient of electric field experienced by the atom. Wall collisions are completely depolarizing, dominating other spin relaxation mechanisms if not suppressed.\n",

        "Most effective coatings usually melt at 60-80°C, except for OTS up to 170°C (see Scott F. Seltzer PhD Thesis). The point of the coating is to allow atoms to bounces thousands of times before depolarizing, reducing the rate by the same factor.\n",

        "A magnetic field gradient creates a difference in the Larmor frequency of the alkali atoms population, hence a broadening of the resonance. In a coated cell, the alkali atoms travel freely across the cell, sampling the entire volume and average the magnetic field. This somehow removes the gradient effect (motional narrowing).\n",
        "<br>\n",
